                        was a IG-series assassin droid who was a bounty hunter during the New Republic Era. 
                        IG-11 was programmed to follow the protocols of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, and had a 
                        built-in self-destruct mechanism to prevent itself from being captured while working as a hired gun.

                        R5-D4, also referred to as R5 (Arfive) and called "Red" by Luke Skywalker, 
                        was a red and white-striped R5 astromech droid owned by a group of Jawas on 
                        Tatooine in the early days of the Galactic Civil War. Shortly before the Battle 
                        of Yavin, the Jawas attempted to sell him to Owen Lars, but the droid purposely 
                        malfunctioned his motivator at the advice of R2-D2, so that Lars could purchase 
                        R2-D2 in R5-D4's place.

                        C-3PO (See-Threepio) was a 3PO-series protocol droid designed to 
                        interact with organics, programmed primarily for etiquette and protocol. 
                        Sometimes referred to as Threepio, he was fluent in over six million forms of 
                        communication, and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his 
                        many decades of operation.

                        R2-D2, pronounced Artoo-Detoo and often referred to as R2 (Artoo),
                        was an R2-series astromech droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton 
                        with masculine programming. A smart, spunky droid who would serve a 
                        multitude of masters over his lifetime, R2-D2 was never given a full 
                        memory wipe nor did he ever receive new programming, with these factors 
                        resulting in an adventurous and independent attitude.

                         powerful weapons, and jump packs for increased flexibility and tactical
